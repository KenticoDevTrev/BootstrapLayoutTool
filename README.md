*Note: You can hover over the various field's input's to get tooltips such as Bootstrap 4 class name conventions*

# Form Sections
For .Net Core KX 13 Refresh 2 (hotfix 31), this tool now has a dynamic Bootstrap Layout Form Section.  This will allow you to more easily implement .net core.  I only created this on the .net Core version for now, if you need this for Xperience 13 .net 4.8, please message me and i'll convert it (pain to do, so hoping to avoid).

# Form Widget Overrides
Included in the repo is a class you can include on your MVC solution to fix up the form widget rendering to be more bootstrap orientated.  You can copy and paste and the modify this as you need!
